    "# My DataBase of Favourite Movies\n",
    "Here is how to create a database including DB design and a simple python implementation. We will use SQLite3 that comes with Python and while being limited for small DB projects, it's an immediate way to get familiar with the SQL language common to all relational DB management softwares. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example here, we will create a database to manage the metadata of my favourite movies, including entities such as actors, directors and awards. The goal is to store all this information and be able to ask questions like: which of my favourite movies are by Quentin Tarantino? or which are the best rated movies with Geoffrey Rush I ever watched?

    "First of all we need to design the architecture of our DB. The easiest way is to design the Entity Relation Diagram (ERD). This can be done online using ERDplus.com. \n",
    "\n",

    "The ERD diagram represents the logical structure of the information to be stored. Although it looks jumbly at first, it's logic can be easily grasped, for example the \"Actors\" are connected to \"Movies\" because they \"starred in\" them, while they have no direct connection to \"Directors\" uless through the \"Movies\" that where \"Directed by\" them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of a ERD is to break down the project into:\n",
    "1. **Entities** (in box e.g. movies, actors) which are self-contained logical entities\n",
    "2. **Relationships** (in diamonds e.g. directed by, movie award) \n",
    "3. **Attributes** are attached to entities or relationships (in oval e.g. the title, year, actor's name)\n",
    "  * **Primary keys** (bold underlined e.g. actor_ID) are the most common example of *unique identifier* and are necessary elements of a relational DB. They allow to ensure data-integrity and to eventually create the relashioships between different entities in the DB\n",
    "  * **Multivalue** attributes (in double oval e.g. a movie can have multiple producers, or rated by different institutions)\n",
    "\n",
    "The connecting lines between entities are part of the relationship and the symbols on either ends is called **cardinality** and depicts for example a one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many relationship.
